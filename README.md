# CSE222 Repository

This repo contains lecture, homework, and exam code from my CSE222-Computer Architecture and Organization class at SCC College in Spring 2023. This class mainly served as an introduction to low level programming(Logic Gates, Circuts, Multiplexers, Decoders, etc), creating assmebly programs, number/base conversions, basic introduction to C programming, and more. All assembly programs were coded in MIPS32 Assembly. Files beginning in "HW" correspond to homework code and files beginning with the date correspond to lecture code.


## Topics/Code Included:

* R-Type, I-Type, and J-Type instructions
* Register types(standard, temp, hi/lo, sp)
* Branch instructions(beq, bne, beqz, etc)
* Arrays and Loops
* Functions and Nested Functions
* Big Endian/Little Endian
* Shifts(Logic and Arithmetic)
* Basic C Programs
    
and more








## Class Syllabus

* Discuss the organization of the classical von Neumann machine and its major functional units.
* Discuss modern computer architecture and organization.
* Explain why everything, including instructions, is data in computers.
* Explains the various ways of representing numerical and non-numerical data.
* Understand different instruction formats and how instructions are represented at both the machine level and in the context of a symbolic assembler.
* Understand other topics include interrupts and I/O operations, and subroutine calls handled at the assembly level.
* Write simple assembly language program segments.
* Demonstrate how to map between high-level language patterns into an assembly/machine language.
* Shows how fundamental high-level programming constructs are implemented at the machine-language level.
* Discuss principles of system memory and virtual memory management and data access from a magnetic disk drive.
